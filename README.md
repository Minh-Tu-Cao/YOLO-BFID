# YOLO-BFID: Real-Time Building Façade Inspection with Drones

YOLO-BFID is a lightweight, real-time semantic segmentation model based on YOLOv11, specifically optimized for detecting façade defects (such as tile peeling, defective tile sealing, and spalling) in complex urban environments. This repository includes the full source code, pretrained model checkpoints, and sample test data for reproducing the results in the paper:

"YOLO-BFID: Real-Time Building Façade Inspection by Using an Advanced Artificial Vision Model Integrated with Drone Technology"

The model integrates advanced modules, including GELAN, SCDown, C2fCIB, and Focus, and is designed for deployment on drone-based inspection systems with RTMP streaming support.

(All codes and trained models will be available along with the publication of the paper)
